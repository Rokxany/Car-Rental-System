# Car Rental System

## Overview

The **Car Rental System** is a Java-based application designed to automate and streamline the car rental process. By leveraging key data structures such as Linked Lists, Queues, and Stacks, this system enhances efficiency, reduces manual errors, and improves customer satisfaction.

## Features

- **Customer Booking**: Handles customer requests using a queue.
- **Vehicle Availability**: Dynamically updates car availability using a linked list.
- **Rental Transactions**: Tracks transaction history using a stack for easy undo operations.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Java  
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA  
- **Data Structures Used**:  
  - Linked List: For dynamic data storage.  
  - Queue: To manage booking requests.  
  - Stack: For tracking rental history.

## How It Works

1. Customers book cars, and requests are queued.
2. The system checks car availability and updates dynamically.
3. Transactions are recorded in a stack to maintain a rental history.

### Example Workflow
1. **Customer A** books a car → System checks availability → Transaction is saved → Customer gets the car.
2. **Customer B** cancels a booking → Stack helps undo the transaction.

## Impact

- Faster booking process, reducing customer wait times.
- Fewer booking errors and improved operational efficiency.
- Enhanced customer and business satisfaction.

## Project Objectives

1. Automate the car rental process to minimize errors and delays.
2. Optimize data handling with efficient data structures.
3. Improve usability for both businesses and customers.
